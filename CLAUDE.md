# Great Lake Cleaners — Project Context

## Identity

**Organization:** Great Lake Cleaners  
**Tagline:** The lake starts here.  
**Mission:** Regular cleanups of Guelph's local waterways — by foot and paddle — that flow into the Great Lakes system via the Grand River and Lake Erie.  

---

## ⚠️ Packaging — ALWAYS use repack.ps1

**After every edit session, run:**
```
! powershell -File repack.ps1
```

**Never** use `Compress-Archive`, Python `zipfile`, or `ZipFile.CreateFromDirectory` directly — all produce broken zips (wrong separators, missing directory entries, or mangled bytes). Only `repack.ps1` produces WordPress-valid zips with correct entry structure.

## WordPress Plugin: `great-lake-cleaners`

**File:** `great-lake-cleaners-plugin.zip`  
**Install:** Plugins → Upload → Activate. No other plugins required (ACF dependency removed).  
**Prefix:** functions/constants `glc_` / `GLC_`, CSS classes `.glc-`  
**After install or update:** Deactivate and reactivate the plugin once to trigger the rewrite rule flush (uses a transient — fires automatically on the next page load after activation).

### Custom Post Type: `cleanup_event`

Fields via native "Cleanup Details" meta box below the block editor.

| Field | Meta key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cleanup Date | `cleanup_date` | YYYY-MM-DD — must be this format for correct archive sorting |
| Site Name | `site_name` | display name |
| GPS Latitude | `gps_lat` | decimal degrees |
| GPS Longitude | `gps_lon` | negative for Ontario |
| Volunteers | `volunteers` | headcount |
| Volunteer Hours | `hours` | person-hours (duration × people) |
| Bags | `bags` | garbage bags |
| Weight (kg) | `weight_kg` | |
| Items Recycled | `items_recycled` | cans + bottles |
| Recyclables Weight (kg) | `recycled_weight_kg` | weight of cans + bottles — not added to debris total; stored for future surfacing |
| Tires Removed | `tires_removed` | integer count — feeds [glc_impact_highlights] |
| Hazardous Waste Removed | `hazards_removed` | paint cans, motor oil, appliances, e-waste, etc. — stored but not currently surfaced in any shortcode |
| Notable Finds | `notable_finds` | |
| Native Species Planted | `species_planted` | |
| Metres Bank Cleared | `meters_bank_cleared` | displayed as km if ≥ 1000 m |
| Wildlife Observed | `wildlife_obs` | |
| Instagram Post URL | `instagram_url` | link to field log |

**Editing:** Open post → scroll below editor → Cleanup Details → Update.  
**Titles** are display labels only — rename freely.  
**GPS:** Google Maps — phone: tap blue dot → coordinates at top. Desktop: right-click location → coordinates at top of context menu.  
**Date format:** Always `YYYY-MM-DD`. The archive sorts using `strcmp` on this format — display-format dates like `Mar 30` will be normalised at render time by `strtotime()`, but it's better to store them correctly.

### Community Submission Post Type: `glc_submission`

Public form via `[glc_submit_form]` shortcode. Submissions land as `pending`. Admin reviews in WP Admin → Submissions, publishes (counts in stats) or trashes. Email notification on each submission. Photos (up to 5) attached to post.

**CPT settings:** `publicly_queryable: true`, `exclude_from_search: true`, `query_var: true`, `rewrite slug: cleanup-submission`. Public single-post URLs resolve to `/cleanup-submission/{slug}/`.

**Stats counting:** Published submissions count fully toward all public stats — cleanup count, weight, items recycled, and volunteer hours. The goal is for community members to make a mark: their efforts and cleanups appear on the map and are reflected in every cumulative total alongside the org's own outings.

**Community submission meta keys:**

| Field | Meta key |
|---|---|
| Submitter Name | `glc_submitter_name` |
| Email | `glc_email` |
| Cleanup Date | `glc_cleanup_date` |
| Waterway | `glc_waterway` |
| Site / Location | `glc_site_name` |
| GPS Latitude | `glc_gps_lat` |
| GPS Longitude | `glc_gps_lon` |
| Duration (min) | `glc_duration_min` |
| Bags | `glc_bags` |
| Weight (kg) | `glc_weight_kg` |
| Garbage Notes | `glc_garbage_notes` |
| Cans (#) | `glc_cans` |
| Bottles (#) | `glc_bottles` |
| Items Recycled (total) | `items_recycled` |
| Weight for stats | `weight_kg` |
| Volunteers | `glc_volunteers` |
| Person-Hours | `glc_hours` |
| Notable Finds | `glc_notable_finds` |
| Instagram URL | `glc_instagram_url` |
| Photo Repost Consent | `glc_photo_repost_ok` |
| Photo IDs | `glc_photo_ids` |

Note: `items_recycled` and `weight_kg` are stored under those exact keys (matching `cleanup_event`) so `glc_get_impact_stats()` can count them without special-casing.

**`glc_get_impact_stats()`** is defined in `theme/functions.php` (not the plugin) and powers the footer stats strip on every page. It counts both `cleanup_event` and `glc_submission` posts for: cleanup count, weight_kg, items_recycled, and hours (`hours` for events, `glc_hours` for submissions). Corridors count is cleanup_event only (no equivalent field on submissions). If the footer stats and a shortcode show different totals, the most likely cause is this function missing a post type or using the wrong meta key for submissions.

### Submission Form — Thank-You / Receipt State

After a successful submission, `[glc_submit_form]` shows:
1. A receipt line: *"You submitted: 3 bags, 6.0 kg, Parkwood Gardens, April 3"* — built from `$_POST` data still available after `glc_maybe_handle_submission()` returns `'success'`. Each part (bags, weight, location, date) is conditional — omitted if the field was empty.
2. The `stylized-thankyou.png` illustration.
3. The thank-you heading and body text.

CSS class: `.glc-submit-receipt` — green-tinted pill badge, defined in theme's `style.css`.

### Report an Issue (`[glc_report_form]`)

Public form via `[glc_report_form]` shortcode on page slug `report-issue`. **Email-only — no CPT, no admin review queue.** Reports go directly to `info@greatlakecleaners.ca` via `wp_mail()`.

**Two-stage flow:**
1. **Triage cards** — side-by-side. City issues routed to Guelph's ArcGIS tool (external link). Waterway issues reveal the form via JS (no page reload, smooth scroll).
2. **Form** — four sections: About You (optional), The Issue (date/waterway/description), Location (text + GPS), Photos (up to 3).

**Email delivery:** Photos attached directly to the outbound email via `wp_mail()` attachments (temp files, cleaned up after send). `Reply-To` header set to reporter's email if provided, so replies go directly to them.

**Success state** surfaces GRCA Spills Line (1-800-265-6613, 24 hr) and Environment Canada number for active hazards.

**Error handling:** validation errors re-show the form section open (not hidden) so the user doesn't need to click the triage button again. Required-field validation errors return `['field' => 'field_id', 'message' => '...']` from the handler — the form rendering uses this to set `aria-invalid="true"` and `aria-describedby="glc-err-{field_id}"` on the offending input and render an inline `.glc-field-error` span. Non-field errors (security, rate limit) return a plain string and show in the `.glc-form-error` banner at the top. Same pattern applies in `submission.php`.

**Destination email:** `GLC_REPORT_EMAIL` constant defined in `report.php` as `info@greatlakecleaners.ca`.

**Required indicator CSS:** Both forms use `.glc-required` (defined in `style.css` as `color: var(--glc-red); flex-shrink: 0`). The `*` span must sit **inside** `.glc-label-text` to stay inline — placing it outside causes it to wrap to a new line in the column flex layout.

### Shortcodes

| Shortcode | Output |
|---|---|
| `[glc_stats]` | Cumulative totals banner |
| `[glc_map]` | Leaflet map of cleanup locations. Attributes: `height` (CSS value), `post_id` (single-event mode), `limit` (max markers per geographic cluster, 0 = no limit), `cluster_radius` (km radius for grouping nearby markers, 0 = no clustering). Hero uses `limit="5" cluster_radius="10"`, archive uses `limit="7" cluster_radius="10"`. Clustering is greedy: markers sorted by impact score (kg + bags×2), each joins the nearest cluster anchor within `cluster_radius` km or starts a new cluster — so dense areas (Guelph) are trimmed while sparse outliers (Rockwood, KW) show all their pins. |
| `[glc_archive]` | Paginated cleanup archive |
| `[glc_submit_form]` | Community submission form |
| `[glc_gallery]` | Photo gallery with year tabs + lightbox |
| `[glc_report_form]` | Waterway issue report (two-stage: triage → form → email) |
| `[glc_timeline]` | Cumulative debris (kg) + items recycled over time — dual Y-axis Chart.js line chart; includes cleanup_event + glc_submission data. **No longer called by page-stats.php** (superseded by the inline SVG charts in the redesign) but still available as a shortcode. |
| `[glc_impact_highlights]` | Three stat cards (unique sites, tires, total cleanups) + cumulative person-hours chart — unique sites, hours, and total cleanups include glc_submission data; tires are cleanup_event only (no equivalent field on submissions). **No longer called by page-stats.php** (superseded by the redesign) but still available as a shortcode. |
| `[glc_references]` | Wrapping shortcode — hides an inline reference list and replaces it with a gold-bordered trigger button. Clicking slides in a navy-headed panel from the right. Close via ✕, backdrop click, or Escape. Usage: `[glc_references]<ol>...</ol>[/glc_references]` in a Custom HTML block. Button label auto-counts `<li>` items: "Sources & References (12)". CSS/JS embedded once per page via static flag. |
| `[glc_join_crew]` | Email signup form — submits via AJAX to `crew-signup.php`. Sends notification to `info@greatlakecleaners.ca`. Rate limit: 3 attempts per IP per 10 minutes (transient key `glc_crew_{ip_hash}`). Honeypot + nonce protected. No CPT — email-only. |
| `[glc_wildlife_log]` | Chronological list of wildlife sightings — all `cleanup_event` posts with a `wildlife_obs` value, sorted newest first. Each entry shows date, site name, observation text, and a "View outing →" link. **No longer called by page-stats.php** (superseded by the redesign's wildlife chip cards) but still available as a shortcode. |

## WordPress Theme: `great-lake-cleaners-theme`

**File:** `great-lake-cleaners-theme.zip`  
**Install:** Appearance → Themes → Upload → Activate.  
**PHP upload limit:** Default WordPress limit is too small for the theme zip. Set in `/etc/php/8.3/apache2/php.ini`: `upload_max_filesize = 64M`, `post_max_size = 64M`, `max_execution_time = 300`, then `sudo systemctl restart apache2`.  
**Cache busting:** `GLC_THEME_VERSION` in `functions.php` (and the matching `Version:` header in `style.css`) must be bumped whenever CSS or JS changes need to reach production. WordPress appends this as `?ver=X.X.X` on enqueued assets — if the version doesn't change, browsers serve the cached old file. Bump both values together and repack.

### Visual Identity

- **Navy:** `#1a4a6b` (single value — `--glc-navy`)
- **Gold:** `#f5a623` (`--glc-gold`)
- **Gold deep:** `#e08e12` (`--glc-gold-deep`) — used for eyebrow text and dot-grid scale label on stats page
- **Green:** `--glc-green` (accent for pills, labels, stat labels)
- **Green dark:** `--glc-green-dark: #1a5e35` — ≈7:1 on green-light; used for `.glc-fp-label` and `.glc-community-badge` text (WCAG AA)
- **Green light:** `--glc-green-light` (backgrounds for cards, tips)
- **Off-white:** `--glc-off-white`
- **Border:** `--glc-border`
- **Muted:** `--glc-muted: #4d5760` (updated from `#666666` for WCAG AA contrast)
- **Body font:** Lato (`--glc-font-body`)
- **Display font:** Nunito (`--glc-font-display`)
- **Body text color:** `--glc-text`
- **Gutter color:** `#f0f0ee` — used for body background, `.glc-main-outer`, and wave footer gradient

### Page Layout Architecture

**This was hard-won through many iterations — do not change without understanding the full chain.**

The page uses a flex column layout to ensure the white content box always fills to the wave, with gray gutters visible on the sides:

```
<body>                        flex column, min-height: 100vh, background: #f0f0ee
  <header .glc-site-header>  sticky, full-width navy
  <div .glc-nav-bar>         full-width navy nav
  <div .glc-main-outer>      flex: 1, flex-direction: column, background: #f0f0ee
    <main .glc-main>         flex: 1, max-width: 1140px, margin: 0 auto, white bg
      (page content)
    </main>
  </div>
  <div .glc-wave-footer>     full-width, linear-gradient background (see below)
  <div .glc-stats-strip>     full-width navy
  <footer>                   full-width navy
</body>
```

**Why `.glc-main-outer` exists:** `<main>` is a centered `max-width: 1140px` column — it can never fill the full viewport width. Without the outer wrapper, short pages leave a gray band between the bottom of `<main>` and the wave. The outer div takes `flex: 1` on the body flex chain, and is itself a flex column so `<main>` can take `flex: 1` and stretch vertically to fill it. Gray body background shows in the side gutters around the centered white box.

**Why `min-height: 100%` does not work** as an alternative: `min-height: 100%` on a flex child only resolves when the parent has a definite CSS height — `flex: 1` alone does not count. The correct pattern is `display: flex; flex-direction: column` on the parent + `flex: 1` on the child, all the way up the chain.

**Wave footer gradient:** The wave sits outside `<main>` as a direct child of `body`. Its background must mirror the content column so the area above the wave crests looks consistent with the page layout (white centre, gray sides). Use:

```css
.glc-wave-footer {
    background: linear-gradient(
        to right,
        #f0f0ee calc(50% - 570px),
        var(--glc-white) calc(50% - 570px),
        var(--glc-white) calc(50% + 570px),
        #f0f0ee calc(50% + 570px)
    );
}
```

570px = half of 1140px max-width. The stats strip and footer are intentionally full-width navy (no gutters).

**Do not** set `background: white` on `body` to solve gray-gap issues — this removes the gutters globally. **Do not** use `min-height` or negative margins to extend the content box — the flex chain is the correct mechanism.

### Header

- Sticky navy header with logo badge (135px, centered vertically)
- Brand name at 2.6rem, tagline in gold uppercase — **tagline hidden on mobile** (compact-always); tagline surfaces in the footer instead
- `::after` pseudo-element creates the wave transition below the header — **never add `overflow: hidden` to `<header>`**, it clips the wave
- Customizer logo setting must be cleared for file-based `glc-badge.png` to take effect
- **`html { overflow-anchor: none }` must be preserved** — disables browser scroll anchoring so the compact header transition does not disturb `scrollY`. Without it, the browser compensates for the header height change by pulling `scrollY` down, which drops below the compact threshold, reverting the header, and causing a flash/oscillation loop.

### Compact Header on Scroll

**Desktop:** collapses after 80 px of scroll; expands again below 40 px (hysteresis prevents oscillation). JS in `nav.js`; CSS class `.is-compact` on `#glc-site-header`.

**Mobile (`≤768px`):** compact styles applied unconditionally in the mobile media query — no full header state. The JS still adds/removes `.is-compact` on scroll but has no visual effect.

| Element | Desktop default | Desktop compact | Mobile (always) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.glc-header-top` | `padding: 8px 0` | `padding: 4px 0` | `padding: 4px 0` |
| `.glc-badge-img` | `height: 135px`, `opacity: 1` | `height: 56px`, `opacity: 0` | `height: 56px`, `opacity: 0` |
| `.glc-badge-sm-img` | `opacity: 0` | `opacity: 1` | `opacity: 1` |
| `.glc-brand-name` | `2.6rem` | `2.6rem` (unchanged) | `2.1rem` |
| `.glc-brand-tag` | visible | hidden | hidden |
| `.glc-nav-menu a` | `padding: 10px 16px` | `padding: 6px 16px` | `padding: 6px 16px` |

All transitions: `0.6s ease-in-out` (badge opacity crossfade at `0.4s`).

**Badge crossfade:** `.glc-badge-sm-img` (the simplified logo) is always in the DOM inside the same `<a>`, absolutely positioned at `top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%)` so it stays vertically centred as the large badge height collapses. The large badge fades out while shrinking; the small badge fades in. `aria-hidden="true"` on the small badge — the large badge's `alt` text already covers accessibility. `.glc-logo-wrap a` has `display: block; position: relative` to anchor the absolutely-positioned small badge.

### Navigation Bar

- Sits below header in its own `.glc-nav-bar` div (same navy background)
- Font: 0.92rem, bold, uppercase, `padding: 10px 16px` (compact: `6px 16px`)
- Gap of 2px between items (no separator lines — tested, doesn't look good in practice)
- Gold bottom-border on active/hover item
- **Submenu** (`.sub-menu`) has **no** `border-top` — the gold top border was removed because it created double-underline artifacts where the nav item's gold bottom-border and the submenu border overlapped

### Footer Structure

1. `.glc-main-outer` closes
2. `.glc-wave-footer` — three-layer SVG wave with gradient background (see above)
3. `.glc-stats-strip` — full-width navy stats bar
4. `<footer>`:
   - `.glc-footer-inner` — nav menu (`padding: 20px 32px 16px`)
   - `.glc-footer-base` — tagline (gold, `.glc-footer-tagline` span) · © year · Privacy Policy · Instagram icon. Single line; tagline sourced from `bloginfo('description')` so it stays in sync with WP Admin site identity.

**Stats strip** — all five stats show a `+` superscript to indicate minimums: `17+ Cleanups · 188+ kg · 26+ Volunteer Hours · 388+ Items Recycled · 3+ River Corridors`. The `kg` and corridors values previously lacked `+`; this was inconsistent and has been corrected.

**Stats strip — all labels are now links**, styled with `.glc-stat-lbl-link` (gold on hover, no underline):
- **Cleanups** → `/cleanups/` archive
- **Debris Removed** → `/stats/#debris` (timeline chart)
- **Volunteer Hours** → `/stats/#hours` (impact highlights chart)
- **Items Recycled** → `/stats/#debris` (same timeline chart as debris)
- **River Corridors** → `/cleanups/#cleanups-map` (map section at bottom of archive)

The stats URL is resolved via `get_page_by_path('stats')` with a `home_url('/stats/')` fallback.

**Instagram hover specificity:** Must be `.glc-footer-base a.glc-footer-insta:hover` to beat `.glc-footer-base a:hover`.

### Three-Layer Footer Wave

SVG viewBox `0 0 1200 80`. Paths:
- **Top layer:** `#5a9fc0` at 45% opacity — lightest, highest crest (y≈28), meets page content
- **Middle layer:** `#2d6a96` — mid blue, lower crest
- **Bottom layer:** `#1a4a6b` — exact footer navy, lowest crest, merges into footer

The `<footer>` has `margin-top: -2px` and the wave div has `margin-bottom: -2px` to close sub-pixel seams.

**Do not add `background` to `.glc-wave-footer` as a solid color** — it needs the gradient (see above) so the area above the wave crests is white in the centre and gray at the sides.

### Maps

Leaflet z-index bug resolved via `isolation: isolate` on all three map wrapper classes — this must be preserved. Leaflet's hardcoded internal pane z-indices (200–600) must be contained within a stacking context to prevent overlapping the sticky header.

### Button Palette

| Class | Resting state | Hover state |
|---|---|---|
| `.glc-btn-primary` | Navy fill, white text | Navy fill, gold text |
| `.glc-btn-outline` | Transparent, navy text, gold border | Gold fill, navy text |
| `.glc-submit-btn` (header) | Transparent, white text, gold border | Gold fill, navy text |
| `.glc-geo-btn` (form) | White fill, navy text, gold border | Gold fill, navy text |
| `.glc-btn-submit` (form) | Inherits `.glc-btn-primary` | Navy fill, gold text |

### Content Page Top Padding

Interior pages need top padding to clear the header wave (`::after` overhangs 38px below the header).

| Wrapper | Desktop padding-top | Mobile padding-top |
|---|---|---|
| `.glc-single-sub-wrap` (single event + submission) | 72px | 56px |
| `.glc-archive-wrap` (cleanups archive) | 72px | 56px |
| `.glc-main` (standard pages) | 0px (inner content padding handles it) | — |

### Front Page Structure

**Wave dividers** — between every section pair: a `<div class="glc-wave-divider">` containing a dual-path SVG wave in muted navy tint (`color: #c3d5e1`), 22px tall. Echoes the header/footer wave identity at low amplitude. No more `<hr>` elements.

**Recent Cleanups spotlight** (section 1, class `glc-fp-spotlight`):

- **Featured card** (`.glc-spot-featured`) — two-column grid (`1.05fr / 1fr`), full linked `<a>`. Left side (`.glc-spot-photo`): sky-blue/green gradient background, real photo if the post has a featured image (covered with `object-fit: cover`), gold "Latest · [date]" pill (`.glc-spot-pill`) overlaid top-left. Right side (`.glc-spot-body`): site name in small-caps green (`.glc-spot-meta`), post title as `<h3>` (`.glc-spot-title`), post excerpt/content trimmed to 25 words as a blurb (`.glc-spot-note`), and a 4-col stat grid (`.glc-spot-stats`) with Bags · Debris · Recycled · Hours.
- **Prior row** (`.glc-spot-prior`) — remaining 3 most-recent cleanups as slim cards, same `.glc-fp-slim-card` style as before.
- **"View all cleanups →"** link (`.glc-spot-view-all`) sits right-aligned in `.glc-spot-footer` *below* the prior row — not next to the heading, to separate it from the hero "See Our Cleanups" CTA.
- Fetches 4 posts total via `glc_get_all_cleanups()`: index 0 = featured, 1–3 = prior.
- Blurb source: `post_excerpt` first, else `wp_trim_words(post_content, 25)`.

**Hours display on cards:** values under 1 hour display as minutes (e.g. `30 min`); values at or above 1 hour display as `1.5 h`. Applied in `front-page.php` (both spotlight and prior cards) and `archive-cleanup_event.php`.

**Front page section images** — real photos, 800px wide, 85% JPEG. `.glc-fp-visual` uses `aspect-ratio: 4/3; position: relative` (not `min-height`; not `display: flex`). `.glc-fp-img` uses `position: absolute; inset: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover`. Portrait photos need `object-position` tuned per image — the "Get Involved" photo uses `style="object-position: center top"` inline to keep the volunteer's face in frame.

**About section heading:** "We're Making an Impact" (no trailing period). Includes an **Our Impact** button linking to `/about/`.

**Get Involved heading:** "Clean your local waterway" (no trailing period). CTA: two-button row — **Follow on Instagram** (primary) + **Join our Crew** (outline). Body copy unchanged.

**Submit a Cleanup heading:** "Did a cleanup? We want to count it" (no trailing period).

### Archive Page (`/cleanups/`)

Left-aligned throughout (pill, heading, intro text, impact section). Fetches all `cleanup_event` and published `glc_submission` posts, merges, sorts by date descending, paginates at 12 per page. Bottom section: Leaflet map only.

The map section div has `id="cleanups-map"` and `scroll-margin-top: 110px` — the River Corridors footer stat links directly to it. The section H2 reads "Every site tells a story" (no trailing period).

### Stats Page (`/stats/`) — `.dirCL-*` redesign

**Template:** `page-stats.php` — fully self-contained. No shortcodes. Queries `cleanup_event` + `glc_submission` posts directly and renders everything inline.

**Layout (top → bottom):**
1. **Hero** (`.dirCL-hero`, `padding: 58px 64px 52px`) — eyebrow pill ("Stopping plastic at the source") then `.dirCL-herostage is-plain` merged panel (2-column grid `1.04fr 0.96fr`, gap 24px, no container chrome — sits directly on white). Left (`.dirCL-herostage-text`): giant gradient debris-kg number (`.dirCL-num`, `clamp(110px,14vw,168px)`, rises via `clip-path` animation), flowing `.dirCL-lede` sentence (bold `.lede-h` opener + body + `.mp` microplastics highlight), two CTAs. Right (`.dirCL-herostage-moose`): gold question "How much debris did we remove?", `moose-scene.png` illustration (500px wide, rises via `glc-rise`), gold "one moose" label absolutely positioned over the body (`top:47%; left:60%`), navy "lifted out of the river" caption below.
2. **Wave separator** (`.dirCL-wave`) — `<svg viewBox="0 0 1200 22">` dual-path wave, `color: #c3d5e1` via `currentColor`, same markup as `.glc-wave-divider` on the front page. Appears before each content section (debris, hours, wildlife).
3. **Debris & Recycling** (`.dirCL-sec`, `id="debris"`) — inline SVG area chart (two series: navy debris, gold recycled), item dot pictograph (gold dots, 11px, 28-column grid).
4. **Hours** (`.dirCL-sec`, `id="hours"`) — inline SVG area chart (green, single series).
5. **Wildlife** (`.dirCL-sec`, `id="wildlife"`) — chip cards (`.dirCL-wchip`), emoji auto-matched from observation text, linked to outing.

**CSS class prefix:** `.dirCL-*` — all stats-page layout classes live in the "Stats Impact Redesign" block in `style.css`.

**`.glc-main` padding override:** `.page-template-page-stats .glc-main { padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0; padding-bottom: 0; }` — sections provide their own padding so content extends edge-to-edge within the 1140px column. Do not add side padding back to `.glc-main` for this page. **Consequence for `.dirCL-wave`:** because `.glc-main` has no side padding, the wave spans the full column width by default. `.dirCL-wave` has `padding: 0 64px` (matching `.dirCL-sec`) so it aligns with the content above and below rather than going gutter-to-gutter.

**SVG charts:** rendered server-side in PHP (no Chart.js on this page). `glc_stats_smooth_path()` and `glc_stats_area_chart()` are defined locally in `page-stats.php`. Charts use Catmull-Rom → cubic bezier curves (tension 0.16), `pathLength="2600"` for consistent stroke-dash animation across varying path lengths.

**Animations:**
- Hero number + moose: `glc-rise` (`clip-path` inset from bottom, 2.1s)
- Chart lines: `glc-line-draw` (stroke-dashoffset 2600→0, 1.9s)
- Chart areas: `glc-fade` (opacity 0→1, 1.3s)
- Dots: `glc-pop` (scale 0.5→1 + fade, staggered by diagonal wave). Dots are hidden by default (`opacity:0; transform:scale(.5)`); an `IntersectionObserver` adds `.glc-dots-visible` to `.dirCL-itemblock` when 10% enters viewport, which triggers the animation. All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

**Moose metaphor:** `count = max(1, round(debris_kg / 350))`. Label: "one moose" (singular) or "N moose". Rendered as `moose-scene.png` (transparent PNG, moose standing in a river with debris collage at the base) displayed at 500px wide with gold label overlay. No drop-shadow on the image — the PNG is transparent and a drop-shadow creates an unexpected border artefact.

**Item dot pictograph:** self-scaling — `itemsPerDot` chosen from `[2,5,10,20,25,50,…]` so grid never exceeds 672 dots (28 cols × 24 rows). Dots are gold (`#f5a623`), `max-width: 11px`. Animation stagger delay = `500 + (col + row) * 16` ms.

**Wildlife emoji:** `glc_stats_wildlife_emoji()` (defined in `page-stats.php`) pattern-matches observation text to assign emoji (turtle→🐢, goose→🪿, duck→🦆, heron→🪶, deer→🦌, moose→🫎, beaver→🦫, otter→🦦, frog→🐸, snake→🐍, hawk/eagle→🦅, crane→🦩, fish→🐟, fox→🦊, default→🌿).

**Footer anchor links** (`#debris`, `#hours`) still work — `.dirCL-sec` has `scroll-margin-top: 110px`.

### Single Event Pages

Both `single-cleanup_event.php` and `single-glc_submission.php` share `.glc-single-sub-wrap` and `.glc-single-event-map`. Both have `isolation: isolate` on the map wrapper. Layout: back link → header → featured image → blog body → stat tiles → finds → map.

### Stat Tiles (single event pages)

Five tiles displayed as a flex row: Bags · Debris (kg) · Items Recycled · Hrs · Bank Cleared.

- **Bank Cleared** is a proper stat tile (not a pill) using `icon-bank.svg`. Auto-formats: values under 1000 m display as `500 m`; values at or above display as `2 km` (trailing zeros stripped via `rtrim`).
- The old emoji-based restoration pill row for bank cleared has been removed. The `🌱 native species planted` pill still renders below Notable Finds if that field is set.
- `.glc-sub-stat-lbl` has `text-align: center` — required so multi-word labels (ITEMS RECYCLED, BANK CLEARED) centre correctly when they wrap to two lines.

### Card Stat Tokens (front page + archive cards)

All stat tokens in `.glc-fp-slim-stats` and `.glc-fp-card-stats` use the `.glc-cs` span pattern:

```php
$ic = function( $icon, $val, $suffix = '' ) use ( $idir ) {
    return '<span class="glc-cs"><img src="' . $idir . '/' . $icon . '" alt="" width="18" height="18" aria-hidden="true">' . esc_html( $val ) . ( $suffix ? ' ' . $suffix : '' ) . '</span>';
};
```

CSS: `.glc-cs { display: inline-flex; align-items: center; gap: 4px; white-space: nowrap; }` — icon and text are locked to the same centre line. The old `vertical-align: -0.2em` hack is gone. Both stat containers use `flex-wrap: wrap` so tokens reflow on narrow cards.

### Photos Page (`/photos/`)

- **Template:** `page-photos.php` (Template Name: Photos) — must be selected in Page Attributes when creating the Photos page in WP Admin
- **Shortcode:** `[glc_gallery]` registered in `shortcodes.php`
- **Intro text:** "See how we make a difference:" — rendered as `.glc-photos-intro` paragraph in `page-photos.php` between the `<h1>` and the shortcode
- **Sources:** Images attached to published `cleanup_event` posts + images from published `glc_submission` posts where `glc_photo_repost_ok = '1'`
- **Gallery flag:** Only attachments with `_glc_gallery = '1'` meta appear in the gallery. All other attachments remain attached to their posts for documentation but are excluded from `/photos/`. This keeps the gallery curated — documentation shots (debris piles, before/after) stay on the outing post without cluttering the gallery.
- **Flagging workflow:** Media Library → click any photo → attachment modal → **Gallery** row at bottom → tick "Feature in photo gallery" → Save. Implemented via `attachment_fields_to_edit` / `attachment_fields_to_save` hooks in `admin.php`.
- **Attachment lookup:** Uses `get_posts( post_parent = $post_id, post_type = attachment, meta_query: _glc_gallery = 1 )` — only works reliably for images **uploaded while editing** the post. Images selected from the pre-existing Media Library may retain their original `post_parent` (0 or another post) and will be missed.
- **Sort order:** Within each year tab, all photos (org + community submissions) are sorted by cleanup date descending — community photos interleave by date rather than falling to the bottom.
- **Layout:** Year tabs (pill buttons, descending) → responsive grid (`auto-fill, minmax(220px, 1fr)`) → vanilla JS lightbox with keyboard nav (←/→/Esc) and backdrop-click to close
- **Thumbnail crop:** `object-position: center top` on `.glc-gallery-thumb-btn img` — anchors to the top of the image when CSS clips it to the `4/3` aspect-ratio container, preventing heads being cropped on portrait photos (Option A). **Option B (not yet implemented):** register a `glc-thumb` custom image size with `crop: ['center', 'top']` in `functions.php`, use it instead of `medium` in the gallery shortcode, then run "Regenerate Thumbnails". Produces a smaller file (exact crop dimensions vs. full medium size downloaded and clipped by CSS) — worth doing if the gallery grows large.
- **Caption overlay:** Site name shown on hover/focus via `.glc-thumb-caption`
- **Lightbox meta bar:** Shows site name · cleanup date · "View outing →" link to the source post
- **Empty state:** Renders a friendly message if no photos are flagged yet

### Submit a Cleanup Page

Two-column layout: form left, sidebar right. Sidebar has three cards: "What happens next?", "Tips for logging", "Our corridors".

Form section order:
1. **About You** — name, email
2. **The Cleanup** — date, duration, number of people, waterway, location, GPS
3. **What You Collected** — garbage (bags, weight, notes), recycling (cans, bottles)
4. **Notable Finds & Field Log** — notable finds textarea, Instagram URL
5. **Photos** — upload + consent checkbox

"Number of People" is in section 2 (not section 3) — it belongs with the outing details, not with what was collected. It has a `?` tooltip: "Used to calculate volunteer hours". "Location" (not "Access Point") — the tooltip says "e.g. Riverside Park, Waterloo Ave bridge". Privacy note under submit button links to `/privacy-policy/`.

### WordPress Pages Required

| Title | Slug | Template | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Home | `home` | (default) | Blank — set as static front page |
| Photos | `photos` | Photos | Leave blank — template calls `[glc_gallery]` |
| Stats | `stats` | Stats | Leave blank — template is self-contained (no shortcodes needed) |
| Submit a Cleanup | `submit-cleanup` | (default) | Leave blank — template handles layout |
| Privacy Policy | `privacy-policy` | (default) | Leave blank — template handles content |
| Report an Issue | `report-issue` | (default) | Leave blank — template handles layout |
| Join our Crew | `join-crew` | Join our Crew | Leave blank — template handles layout + embeds [glc_join_crew] |

### Accessibility

- **Focus styles:** Global `:focus-visible` rule (3px solid `--glc-gold`, 2px offset) at end of `style.css`. Mouse users get `:focus:not(:focus-visible) { outline: none }`. Form inputs use gold outline on `:focus` (overrides the old `outline: none` which was a WCAG 2.4.7 failure). Tooltip uses `:focus-visible` only.
- **Reduced motion:** `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block at end of `style.css` sets all `transition-duration` and `animation-duration` to `0.01ms !important`.
- **Form error UX:** Required-field errors use `aria-invalid="true"` + `aria-describedby` pointing to a `.glc-field-error` inline span. Non-field errors (security/rate-limit) use a banner at the top. See error handling note in Report an Issue section above.
- **Full-card aria-label:** Front-page slim cards build a descriptive `aria-label` from site name, date, and stat values so screen readers get meaningful link text instead of just the site name.
- **Community badge contrast:** `.glc-community-badge` and `.glc-fp-label` use `--glc-green-dark` instead of `--glc-green` for WCAG AA compliance.
- **screen-reader-text utility:** `.screen-reader-text` class used on "opens in new tab" spans throughout. External links (Instagram, Field log, City report tool) all have this.
- **Instagram header link (WCAG 4.1.2 / 2.5.8):** `aria-label="Follow us on Instagram (opens in new tab)"` on the `<a>`. SVG is `width="24" height="24"` with `aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"`. `.glc-insta-link` has `min-width: 24px; min-height: 24px; padding: 2px` to meet the 24×24 CSS px target-size minimum.
- **Stat card recycled-items suffix:** The `$ic` closure call for recycled items uses `'items'` as the suffix (not empty string) so screen readers hear "33 items" rather than a bare number. Applied in both `front-page.php` and `archive-cleanup_event.php`.
- **Wave SVG (WCAG 1.1.1):** The `.glc-wave-footer` outer div has `aria-hidden="true"`. The `<svg>` element itself also carries `aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="presentation"` for compatibility with older browsers that ignore a parent's `aria-hidden`.
- **Footer stat label contrast (WCAG 1.4.3):** `.glc-stat-lbl` is `color: rgba(255,255,255,0.78)` — confirmed ≈5.3:1 against navy.
- **Footer base links (WCAG 1.4.1 / 1.4.3):** `.glc-footer-base a` must be defined **only once** in `style.css` (in the Site Footer section): `color: white; text-decoration: underline; transition: color 0.15s`. A duplicate rule previously existed in the Privacy Policy section that silently overrode this with `rgba(255,255,255,0.6)` and removed the underline — that duplicate has been removed. Do not re-add a second `.glc-footer-base a` rule elsewhere in the file.
- **Decorative emoji (WCAG 1.1.1):** The `🌱` span in the native-species-planted row (`single-cleanup_event.php`) has `aria-hidden="true"` — the emoji is redundant with the adjacent text.

### Icon Implementation Pattern

Card stat icons use the `$ic` closure (see Card Stat Tokens above). Single-event stat tiles use direct `<img>` tags inside `.glc-sub-stat-icon` spans. **Never** mix PHP variable assignment in one `<?php ?>` block and then reference that variable inside an HTML attribute in a subsequent block. The correct pattern for inline echo:

```php
<?php
$idir = esc_url( get_template_directory_uri() ) . '/assets/images';
if ( $bags ) echo '<span class="glc-cs"><img src="' . $idir . '/icon-bag.svg" alt="" width="18" height="18" aria-hidden="true">' . esc_html( $bags ) . ' bags</span>';
?>
```


## Next Steps

- [ ] **Donate / support page** — Simple page (no crowdfunding). E-transfer or PayPal link, honest note that tax receipts aren't available until CRA charitable registration post-incorporation, brief breakdown of what funds cover (bags, gear, hosting). Link from "Get Involved" section on front page and footer nav. **Blocked on:** deciding on a dedicated e-transfer email or PayPal account to receive funds — use a separate address from `info@` to keep finances distinct.
- [ ] Consider physical badge ("Watershed Steward" patch) for top contributors at year-end — award based on cleanups logged (3+), not weight or volume
- [ ] **Gallery thumbnail Option B** — register `glc-thumb` custom image size with `crop: ['center', 'top']` in `functions.php`, update gallery shortcode to use it instead of `medium`, run "Regenerate Thumbnails". Reduces payload for portrait photos (server-side crop vs. CSS clip). Do when gallery is large enough that load time matters.
